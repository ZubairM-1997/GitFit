# README

This is an webapp I made in preparation for Flatiron School's project week for Module 2, where we focused on MVC (Model View Conroller) framework, relationships between models and how pages link together more dynamically using rails. I apologise for the lack of front end development, I was running short on time but the app works (after hours staring behind my screen). This webapp is called GitFit, it allow's users to make their meal plans and workouts more efficiently. You are free to make changes to this app if you want.

To run this file
1) Fork and Clone,
2) Go to the directory where you saved this (via terminal),
3) type "rails s" to boot up the server, 
4) go to localhost:3000/new/users to sign up and use the app,
5) Enjoy!
